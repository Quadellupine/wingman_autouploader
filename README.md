# Scuffed little uploader
Therw it together because the official uploader doesnt work on Linux. Or maybe Im just stupid.
Does nothing fancy, it watches for new logs and uploads them to dps.report and then adds that to the wingman queue.

To use it all you need to do is\
 ```pip install requests```\
(I think)

Feel free to steal this for anything. Maybe Ill make it less scuffed in the future.\
Last tested with my python 3.7 setup on Arch Linux and the state of dps.report/wingman APIs as of 27.10.2023.
